SQL Injection Tool
This Python script is designed to demonstrate SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. It helps users understand how attackers can exploit such vulnerabilities and how developers can mitigate them.

Purpose
The script serves an educational purpose, allowing users to:

Determine the number of columns in an SQL database table through inference.
Perform SQL injection attacks to extract database information, such as database version, schema names, table names, and column names.
Extract specific data from database tables, such as user credentials, using SQL injection techniques.
Features
Column Count Inference: Automatically determines the number of columns in a database table by testing SQL injection payloads.
SQL Injection Attacks: Executes union-based SQL injection attacks to extract sensitive information from the database.
Dynamic Input: Uses command-line arguments to specify URL, expected content length, keyword filtering, and form field names (email and password).
Usage Instructions
Setup: Ensure Python and necessary libraries (requests) are installed.

Determining Content Length: Use the --content option to specify the expected response length during a normal login attempt to the target URL.

Executing the Script: Run the script with appropriate command-line arguments:

python s9.py http://example.com/login --content 33490 --keyword Welcome --email email --pass password
http://example.com/login: URL of the vulnerable login page.
--content 33490: Expected length of the response body during a normal login attempt.
--keyword Welcome: Optional keyword to filter the response content.
--email email: Name of the email input field in the login form.
--pass password: Name of the password input field in the login form.
Output: The script prints discovered information such as the number of columns, database version, schema names, table names, column names, and extracted data based on user input.

Note
Security and Legal Considerations: Ensure you have appropriate authorization to test and demonstrate SQL injection vulnerabilities on websites. Unauthorized testing may be illegal and unethical.
Educational Use: This script is designed to enhance understanding of SQL injection vulnerabilities and should not be used for malicious purposes.
Disclaimer
This tool is created solely for educational purposes to showcase Python programming skills and understanding of SQL injection vulnerabilities. Use responsibly and with explicit permission for testing purposes only.
